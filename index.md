## About Me

Hi there! Welcome! I curently reside in [Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi), a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world, where I (at least try to) study mathematics, number theory in particular. My research supervisor is [Dr. Abhash Kumar Jha](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/people/abhashmat), whom I joined December, 2020. We mainly work in modular forms, Jacobi forms and corresponding Poincaré series.

Previously, I was a state JRF in [University of North Bengal](https://nbu.ac.in/) for few months,  where I studied [Solid Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_mechanics).

I completed B.Sc. in Mathematics Honours (2013-2016) from [Cooch Behar College](https://coochbeharcollege.ac.in/) and M.Sc. (2016-2018) in Mathematics from [University of North Bengal](https://nbu.ac.in/). If you want to go back further, I did my schooling from [Nivedita Shishu Vidya Mandir](https://schools.org.in/koch-bihar/19030404801/deocharai-nivedita-shishu-vidya-mandir.html) (1999-2005) and [Deocharai High School](https://school.banglarshiksha.gov.in/ws/website/index/19030404701) (2005-2011) and [Cooch Behar Rambhola High School](https://school.banglarshiksha.gov.in/ws/website/index/19031700101) (2011-2013).

## Research Interests

- **Modular forms** 
- **Automorphic Representations** 
- **Mock Modular forms** 
- **L-functions**

## Ongoing Works
- Orthogonal Modular forms and their properties
- Trying to get my head around automorphic representations

## Hobbies
-  Literature! Any kind of Bengali literature. From বঙ্কিমচন্দ্র to শ্রীজাত, anything!
-  Music! 
<!-- I find myself in an awkward place when I think about my tasteas. I love রবীন্দ্র সঙ্গীত, but Rocks, Metals attract me also. I love Bengali classical and folks and their modern renditions. Also, Bollywood, of course! -->
