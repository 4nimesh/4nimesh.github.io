## About Me

Hi there! Welcome! I curently reside in [Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi), a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world, where I (at least try to) study mathematics, number theory in particular. 

My research supervisor is [Dr. Abhash Kumar Jha](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/people/abhashmat), whom I joined December, 2020. We mainly work in modular forms, Jacobi forms and corresponding Poincar√© series.

Previously, I was a state JRF in [University of North Bengal](https://nbu.ac.in/) for few months,  where I studied [Solid Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_mechanics).

I completed B.Sc. in Mathematics Honours (2013-2016) from [Cooch Behar College](https://coochbeharcollege.ac.in/) with 76% and M.Sc. (2016-2018) in Mathematics from [University of North Bengal](https://nbu.ac.in/) with 72%.

If you want to go back further, I did my schooling from [Nivedita Shishu Vidya Mandir](https://schools.org.in/koch-bihar/19030404801/deocharai-nivedita-shishu-vidya-mandir.html) (1999-2005) and [Deocharai High School](https://school.banglarshiksha.gov.in/ws/website/index/19030404701) (2005-2011) and [Cooch Behar Rambhola High School](https://school.banglarshiksha.gov.in/ws/website/index/19031700101) (2011-2013).
