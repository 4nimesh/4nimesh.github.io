## About Me

I am interested in Analytic (and algebraic) Number Theory and their applications in physics. 

My ongoing works are on Siegel modular forms,  Hermitian modular forms and modular forms associated to orthogonal group. I also work on analytic behaviour of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. I want to explore further in the areas like elliptic curves, mock modular forms, and the theory of $L$-functions.
## Research Interests

- **Analytic Number Theory:** Modular forms
