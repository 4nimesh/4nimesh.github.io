## About Me

Hi there! Welcome! I cureently reside in [Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi), a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world. I (at least try to) study mathematics, number theory in particular. 

My research supervisor is [Dr. Abhash Kumar Jha](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/people/abhashmat), whom I joined December, 2020. We mainly work in (Siegel/Hermitian/Orthogonal) modular forms, Jacobi forms and Poincar√© series and their properties.

## Research Interests
